# Html-CSS-Practice
I've been actively enhancing my proficiency in HTML and CSS by engaging in practical exercises using files organized within folders. My learning journey involves hands-on practice with coding projects and drawing knowledge from various online resources. This hands-on approach has proven effective in reinforcing my understanding of web development concepts and refining my skills in creating stylish and functional web pages.
